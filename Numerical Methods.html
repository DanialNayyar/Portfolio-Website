    <h2>üîß Overview</h2>
    <p>This two phased project investigaterd the fluid flow through curved geometries and the effects of those flows on the piping system's structural integrity. It combined research and implementation by first conducting a literature review of the topic and then using the data as a validation metric after the simulations were completed. The simulations were conducted with ANSYS Fluent and Mechanical APDL with the geometries being modelled in SolidWorks. This project as a whole focused on flow profiles, pressure gradients and the formation of secondry flows with special attention on Dean vorticies. Various Reynolds numbers were used (ranging from 1000 to 3000 Re) to simulate the flow, alongside multiple mesh densites to valide the results with analytical results and also to evaluate the pipe integrity under pressure surges.</p>

    <h2>üéØ Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the behavior of fluid flow through curved geometries</li>
      <li>Investigate the effects of curvature ratio on pressure distribution and velocity</li>
      <li>Identify and analyse the formation of Dean vorticies</li>
      <li>Evaluate the pipe's strucutral integrity under pressure surges</li>
      <li>Demonstrate the effect of mesh refinement and boundary conditions on CFD accuracy</li>
      <li>Compare simulation results against literature review data e.g. Molki et al., 2013 </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SolidWorks: Construction of pipe geometries<li>
      <li>ANSYS: Conduct CFD simulations for both laminar and turbulent flows</li>
      <li>Python & MATLAB: Calculation and plotting of Velocity profiles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìä Key Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Curvature Ratio:</strong> Increased curvature ratio caused greater distortion to axial velocity profiles as well as the formation of Dean vorticies</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure gradients:</strong> Build across pipe section during bends, higher pressure on the outside wall</li>
      <li><strong>Straight Pipe validation:</strong> The simulated velocity profile was in agreement with Molki et al., (error of less than 1%)</li>
      <li><strong>Mesh Sensitivity:</strong> Accuracy increased with element refinement (upto a point)</li>
      <li><strong>Structural Integrity:</strong> Pipe remained structurally sound due to steel's structural properties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üß† Reflections</h2>
    <p>This project highlighted how even relatively simple geometries can cause complex flow profiles to form that can be detrimental to the structure. ANSYS is a phenomenal tool for simulating fluid flows and validating results against experimental data. A vital insight came from mesh optimisation, it highlighted the balance that needs to be achieved to balance the computational cost and simulation accuracy </p>
